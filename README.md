# Coin-Value

This is a Fortran program that makes the change for a country created by our professor Hunter Lloyd in which an input between 1 to 99 represents the amount of Looney money that will need to be converted to coins. 

The coins and their equivalence are below:
- Lunker: 30 cents
-Loonter: 15 cents
- Little: 5
-Pooney: 1

This information is outputted in both a list and column with the date and time printed as well. 

To Run -
    gfortran change.f90 -o (what ever you would like the name of the file to compile to)
